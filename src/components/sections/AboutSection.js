                        My love for interactive websites and motion design eventually led me into UI/UX design. I started out designing interfaces and coding them before fully embracing a design-first approach. Over the years, I’ve explored various design disciplines, starting with logo creation and branding projects to creating marketing collaterals while volunteering in student organizations like AIESEC, where I grew to lead marketing teams. A standout moment was running a campaign that converted 65% of registered delegates into paid attendees in less than a month—a testament to teamwork, strategy, and creative execution.
